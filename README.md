# Welcome to Rust Respawn 🦀

**Rust Respawn** is a personal learning repository created while revisiting Rust
after a long break.  
It contains coursework and hands-on exercises from the Udemy course:

## Purpose

This repository serves as a structured space to refresh and strengthen core Rust
concepts through small, focused projects and exercises.  

Each project explores one or more fundamental topics.
---

## Repository Contents

This repository includes multiple independent Rust projects, each located in its
own subdirectory.  

Most projects are intentionally minimal and focus on demonstrating specific
language features or concepts.

---

## Concepts Covered

The exercises in this repository explore a variety of Rust fundamentals,
including (but not limited to):

- Rust’s ownership model and borrowing rules for safe and efficient memory
  management
- Enum types and pattern matching
- Creating and organizing Rust projects using modules
- Error handling patterns in Rust
- Rust’s iterator system for efficient data processing
- Generic types and traits
- Advanced lifetime concepts
- Common data structures such as arrays, vectors, and slices
- Working with external crates
- Basic input/output (I/O) operations

These topics are introduced incrementally through simple, focused examples.

## How to Use This Repository

Each subdirectory represents a standalone Rust project.  
To run any project:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
cargo run
